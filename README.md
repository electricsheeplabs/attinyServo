# attinyServo
This code is uploaded to an AVR attiny85 mcu (84 works too) to generate servo control signals based on an analog input. I like this concept because you can now easily make a small controller for servos and ESCs, and hide the tiny thing anywhere on your device! 

I learned all I know (not much) from these folks:
